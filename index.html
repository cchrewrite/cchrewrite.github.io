  <li>My current research is the automation of game development. It enables computers to automatically design computer games, so that different people can create their own games even if they don't know how to write programs. There are several questions to be explored. For example, how to enable computers to understand human's ideas by sound, text and video? How computers design the motions of NPC and the changes of scene? How computers develop reasonable stories and strategies? How computers arrange these elements into a game program...</li>
</ul>
